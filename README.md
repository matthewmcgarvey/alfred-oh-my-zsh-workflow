# Alfred oh-my-zsh Workflow

---

## Why use it

If you are like me and like learning the aliases that oh-my-zsh provides, you might have a couple bookmarks
set up to quickly go and look at a plugin's documentation.  This can get annoying to find the bookmark or manually
navigate to the page and search through the folders.  This workflow is meant to make that process simpler by offering a searchable list of
all the oh-my-zsh plugins to quickly get you to the documentation.
